# DBT: Distributed Block-sparse Tensors

The DBT is a lightweight fork of [DBCSR Tensors](https://github.com/cp2k/dbcsr/tree/develop/src/tensors)
and the related [TAS layer](https://github.com/cp2k/dbcsr/tree/develop/src/tas)
for Tall-and-Skinny matrices.

The code was originally written by Patrick Seewald and is well documented in his
[PhD thesis](https://www.cp2k.org/_media/docs:phd_thesis_patrick_seewald.pdf).
